#FR-Overworld-Form-Change

I hereby present you a project I started soon after I started learning Rom-hacking with C.
(Huge thanks to KDS for his EM-form-cahnge project and being my mentor for C-hacking )

this project includes the form changes handling for a FireRed rom.

This is just a initial release and is in porgress. It is yet not usable.
I will notify when it gets usable.

Till then you can support me here

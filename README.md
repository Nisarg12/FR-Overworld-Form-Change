#FR-Overworld-Form-Change

I hereby present you a project I started soon after I started learning Rom-hacking with C.
(Huge thanks to KDS for his EM-form-cahnge project and being my mentor for C-hacking )

this project includes the form changes handling for a FireRed rom.

This project is almost completed now (actually completed I would say)
